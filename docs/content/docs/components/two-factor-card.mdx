title: <TwoFactorCard />
---

The `<TwoFactorCard />` provides a secure interface for managing two-factor authentication (2FA), allowing users to enable or disable 2FA with password confirmation. It handles the complete setup flow including QR code scanning and backup codes generation.

<img alt="Two Factor Card" src="/screenshots/two-factor-card-dark.png" className="rounded-xl hidden dark:block w-lg mt-0 mb-0" />
<img alt="Two Factor Card" src="/screenshots/two-factor-card-light.png" className="rounded-xl dark:hidden w-lg mt-0 mb-0" />

## Usage

Here's how you can include `<TwoFactorCard />` in your settings page:

```tsx
import { TwoFactorCard } from "@daveyplate/better-auth-ui"

export default function SettingsPage() {
    return (
        <div className="flex flex-col gap-6">
            <TwoFactorCard />
        </div>
    )
}
```

This component automatically handles the complete 2FA workflow through the [`AuthUIProvider`](/components/auth-ui-provider), including QR code generation, verification, and backup codes management.

## Reference

The following props can be utilized to customize `<TwoFactorCard />`:

<AutoTypeTable path="../src/components/settings/two-factor-card.tsx" name="TwoFactorCardProps" />

## Styling

Customize the component appearance using Tailwind CSS classes through the `classNames` prop:

```tsx
<TwoFactorCard
    classNames={{
        base: "border-primary shadow",
        header: "bg-primary-foreground",
        title: "text-primary font-semibold text-xl",
        description: "text-muted-foreground",
        content: "bg-background",

    twoFactorEnabled={user.twoFactorEnabled}
    refetch={refetchUserData}
/>
```
